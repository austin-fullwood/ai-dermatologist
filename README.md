## Overview
A Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow takes in an image file, preprocesses it, and outputs a list of probabilities for each of the 7 classes. The class with the highest probability is deemed the predicted guess.

The CNN is trained on the [Skin MNIST dataset](https://github.com/bundasmanu/skin_mnist) with 10015 different images of different skin lesions.
